2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd redux-intro
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash

   ```

This will start the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any linting errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, and youâ€™ll gain full control over the configuration files.
